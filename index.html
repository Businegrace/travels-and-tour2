    <h1>Historical  Buildings and Monuments</h1>
    
    
    
   <h4 class="Toursite"> Casa Batlló</h4>
     <p> In 1904 <strong>Antonio Gaudí </strong>started the reform of a modest rectangular building to turn it into what today is the <strong>Casa Batlló</strong>, one of the most impressive and admired creations of the Catalan architect that will surprise you with its impossible shapes, its blue tones and the chromatic richness of its windows.

The building symbolises the battle of Sant Jordi, patron saint of Catalonia, against the dragon (representation of evil). On the roof, the spine of the dragon is represented by tiles of different colours in the shape of scales, crossed by a four-armed cross that evokes the sword of Sant Jordi.

The façade, plentiful of curves and colours, represents a calm sea and is the maximum expression of Gaudí’s genius, who knew how to respect the originality of the neighbouring Amatller house in order to establish a dialogue between the two buildings.

For their part, the beautiful interior patios of the building evoke the depths of the sea thanks to the details of the ventilation system and Gaudí’s incredible mastery of light, colour and the different decorative materials (glass, wood, iron, etc.).</p>

    <h4  class="Toursite"> Sagrada Familia</h4>
<p>The main icon of Barcelona and Catalan modernism, the Sagrada Familia is the most visited monument in Spain and one of the most visited in Europe.

An authentic architectural Bible in which the main symbols of the Christian faith are represented.  In this sense, the three facades of the temple evoke the most important moments in the life of Jesus Christ: his birth (calle Marina), his passion, death and resurrection (calle Sardenya), and his glory (calle Mallorca). All of them contain sculptures in which the main passages of his life are recreated: the kiss of Judas, the Last Supper, The Judgement of Jesus, the Ecce Homo, etc.

For its part, the interior of the basilica will transport you to a world of fantasy with which you will fall in love with its precious multicoloured stained-glass windows and the enormous columns in the shape of a tree trunk that remind you of an enormous stone forest.</p>

    <h4  class="Toursite">La Boqueria</h4>
<p>TThe San José Market (in Catalan Mercat de Sant Josep), popularly known as La Boquería 1 ​2​ (in Catalan La Boqueria), is a municipal market located on the Rambla in Barcelona ( Spain ). In addition to being a place where you can buy all kinds of fresh products, it is also a tourist attraction.</p>

    <h1 class="famousdish">Famous Dishes</h1>
    <h4 class="Dishes">Paella</h4>
<p>The quintessential Barcelona dish
And, of course, the quintessential paella cannot be absent from this compilation of typical foods of Barcelona. It is often said that the finest paellas are found in Valencia, and I must admit that I have my reservations. I have specific preferences, favoring seafood paellas that are moist, creamy, and offer a delectable crispiness from the protein ingredients.

Paella is a must try food in Barcelona without any doubts and questions.The most memorable paellas I have savored in Barcelona were at the renowned Maná 75 restaurant in La Barceloneta. However, there are other establishments in the city where you can indulge in a delicious paella. The variety of paella recipes is vast, ranging from vegetable and chicken to seafood, lobster, carabinero rice, and more. Each one deserves a taste!</p>

    <h4 class="Dishes">Bikini</h4>
<p>Barcelona's most fun food
Among the intriguing terms of Catalan gastronomy, one that piques the curiosity of outsiders is the classic “bikini.” Rest assured, you won’t be served a grilled swimsuit or anything of the sort. Instead, it’s a delightful ham and cheese sandwich.

While it may appear as a humble dish that can be found anywhere around the globe, let me assure you that finding a truly exceptional one is no easy feat. That’s precisely why I encourage you to sample the offerings crafted in Barcelona. The secret? It lies in the butter and achieves the perfect level of toasting for each slice of bread.</p>

    <h4 class="Dishes">Patatas Bravas</h4>
   <p>
Undoubtedly the most popular food of Barcelona
“Patatas bravas” , spicy roasted potatoes, is one of those typical Spanish dishes that should be incorporated into the world gastronomy. I can’t imagine hanging out with friends having tapas and not eating the classic patatas bravas. If I could choose the most popular food in Barcelona, it would be Patatas Bravas.

They usually taste sweet and a little bit spicy. In some bars they serve it with aioli and hot brava sauce separately and in others directly with sauces mixed in. Undoubtedly the recipe preferred by the Catalans is that of very crispy potatoes cut in big chunks,  added aioli, brava sauce, and a touch of parsley along with red paprika.

Patatas Bravas is THE MOST typical and popular food in Barcelona, you can find it in any restaurant and it will be delicious.</p>

    <h4 class="Dishes">Pa amb tomaquet</h4>
The classic Barcelona's food
<p>First on the list is the iconic “pa amb tomaquet”, a deceptively simple dish that captures the essence of Catalan cuisine and it’s probably the most popular food in  Barcelonas restaurants.  Once you take a bite, you’ll be hooked, and it will become an indispensable accompaniment to every meal. So, what’s the secret? It all starts with coca bread, which I’ll delve into shortly. Then, a pinch of salt, freshly rubbed tomato on the bread, and a generous drizzle of olive oil completes the magical combination. For an extra kick, I personally enjoy adding garlic, but that’s entirely up to you.</p>

    <h1>Parks</h1>
    
   <h4 class="Parks"> Park Güell</h4>
    <p>
    The best one by far is the famous Park Güell. It's Gaudí's park with the salamander and the mosaic benches. This park definitely has to be part of your city break. Do book your Park Güell tickets in advance, as this part of the park is no longer free and during high season it's likely to be sold out.</p>

   <h4 class="Parks"> Parc de la Ciutadella</h4>
   <p>
The largest park in the city centre of Barcelona dates back to the 1888 World Fair with the Font de Cascada, the Arc de Triomf, and the Barcelona Zoo. The park offers many activities, such as rowing in the lake, picnicking, and relaxing in the shade of beautiful trees.</p>

     <h1 class="Beach">Beaches</h1>
     <h3>Bogatell</h3>
     <p> This small but busy beach lies behind the twin towers (you can identify it by the Peix d'Or, the golden fish) and the Olympic harbour. Many beach bars and a volleyball court. The beach is very popular among the Spanish and the most sporty section of beach of them all.</p>
